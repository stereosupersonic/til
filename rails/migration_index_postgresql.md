# Add an index on postgresql

By default, Postgres locks writes (but not reads) to a table while creating an index on it.
That can result in unacceptable downtime during a production deploy.
On a large table, indexing can take hours.

__itâ€™s a good idea to isolate concurrent index migrations to their own migration files__

The disable_ddl_transaction! method applies only to that migration file. Adjacent migrations still run in their own transactions and roll back automatically if they fail. 
```
class AddIndexToAsksActive < ActiveRecord::Migration
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    reversible do |direction|
      direction.up   { execute("SET SESSION statement_timeout = 0;") }
      direction.down { execute("SET SESSION statement_timeout = 0;") }
    end
    
    add_index :asks, :active, algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```
